Description: A suite of machine learning balance tests and estimation tools for experimental and observational data, including a fast implementation of the classification permutation test (Johann Gagnon-Bartsch and Yotam Shem-Tov, 2019). The purpose of this suite is to detect unintentional failures of random assignment, data fabrication, or simple covariate imbalance in random or, as-if random, experimental designs. These tools are meant to work "off-the-shelf" but are also customizable for advanced users.
