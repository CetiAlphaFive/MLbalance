# MLbalance: Machine Learning Balance

A suite of machine learning balance tests and estimation tools for
experimental and observational data, including a fast implementation of
the classification permutation test (Johann Gagnon-Bartsch and Yotam
Shem-Tov, 2019). The purpose of this suite is to detect unintentional
failures of random assignment, data fabrication, or simple covariate
imbalance in random or, as-if random, experimental designs. These tools
are meant to work "off-the-shelf" but are also customizable for advanced
users.
